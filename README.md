shorturl
========
This is a simple, free, open-source URL shortener, written in 2010 with Python and Django. It is currently used to power [dvlr.it](http://dvlr.it), the private URL shortener used by [Develer](http://www.develer.com).

The code is distributed under the MIT license. You are free to get this code and install it on your own servers / platforms, and use it with your own vanity domain to create a custom URL-shortening service.
